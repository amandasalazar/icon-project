      <p>Spotted lanternflies are an invasive insect species from Asia that seriously threaten New York’s trees and agriculture. The flies are about an inch long, sporting light gray outer wings with black spots, red under wings with black spots and a yellow and black body. They can fly and jump short distances, but are best found covering tree trunks, which is considered an infestation.</p>

  <p>According to City College entomologist and evolutionary biologist David Lohman, SLF are fulgoridae, the same insect family as aphids. These insects have an incomplete metamorphosis, meaning they don’t have a chrysalis or pupa stage. SLF feed by sticking their strawlike mouthpiece into a plant and sucking out the phloem, the nutrient-rich sap that’s self-produced to feed plants. By feeding on the phloem, Lohman explained, the plants lose nutrients and lose the ability to produce fruit. Read on to learn more about how to spot an SLF, why they’re dangerous and what to do if you see one.</p>

    <div class="container text"><p>One way SLF are harmful is that they reduce the ability of plants to produce fruits, especially grapes, by drinking their phloem. Another harm is their poop. Called “honeydew,” their feces are a sticky secretion that feeds black city mold. The more “honeydew” out there, the more mold will grow. Lohman explained that the best way to combat SLF is to find a parasite or predator that feeds only on SLF and bring them here. Once they eat all the SLF, the parasite itself will die off due to a lack of food. “Invasive species are a tremendous problem all over the world now. We can try to ameliorate their effects but, for the most part, it’s very difficult to do,” Lohman said. “For this critter, if we could find a natural parasitoid in its native habitat that specializes only on this particular species, then that would be the ideal situation to control this pest.”</p></div>

    <div class="container text"><p>Though it seems like the SLF situation is new, there have been sightings of them in the United States as early as 2014. In 2020, their population in states grew, with the first New York State infestation occurring on Staten Island in July 2020. SLF originate from East Asia, primarily China and Vietnam, and prefer to live and feed on the tree of heaven, native to China but an invasive species in the United States. It is thought that the first SLF were brought to America on a shipment from China in 2012.</p></div>

    <div class="container text"><p>SLF go through four main life stages that each are visually distinct from one another. It’s important to be able to recognize a SLF at various stages in order to report sightings. Adult SLF lay one inch long, gray-brown egg masses on tree trunks. They start hatching from April through July into early-stage nymphs, which are small, black, oval-shaped bugs with white spots. Late-stage nymphs are the same shape, but are larger and red with white spots. They then mature into the adult SLFs that we see fluttering around and congregating on trees.</p></div>

    <div class="container text"><p>The New York City Parks Department is instructing people to “squish, dispose and report” their sightings of SLF. If you spot an egg mass on a tree, NYC Parks recommends scraping the mass into a Ziploc filled with hand sanitizer to kill the eggs. If you come across a nymph or adult SLF, it’s recommended you stomp on the bug. You’re also asked to check your car for egg masses before driving out-of-state. Before killing the bugs at any life stage, though, NYC Parks wants you to snap a photo of the sighting and email, it along with the location, to spottedlanternfly@agriculture.ny.gov to officially report and record the sighting.</p></div></div></div>
